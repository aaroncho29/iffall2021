            <p class="section">Ingredients</p>
            <p>1 small green bell pepper, diced</p>
            <p>2 ribs celery, diced</p>
            <p>1 small white onion, diced</p>
            <p>6 garlic cloves, minced</p>
            <p>1/2 cup vegetable oil</p>
            <p>1/2 cup all purpose flour</p>
            <p>2 bay leaves</p>
            <p>8 ounces non-light beer</p>
            <p>4 cups chicken stock</p>
            <p>1 lb andouille sausage or smoked kielbasa, cut into coins</p>
            <p>1 lb boneless, skinless, chicken thighs</p>
            <p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
            <p>1 tbsp cayenne pepper</p>
            <p>1 tbsp smoked paprika</p>
            <p>Cooked white rice, for serving</p>
            <p>Sliced scallions, for garnish</p>
            <p class="section">Method</p>
            <p>1. Take 1 small green bell pepper, 2 ribs of celery, and 1 small white onion (also known as the “holy trinity”) and dice them into medium-sized pieces. Set aside for later.</p>
            <p>2. Mince 6 garlic cloves and set aside for later.</p>
            <p>3. For the roux, add ½ cup of vegetable oil to a pot and allow it to get smoking hot before adding ½ cup of all purpose flour. Using a wooden spoon or preferably a whisk, mix together until the consistency is similar to wet sand.</p>
            <p>4. Within 30 seconds, the roux should be the color of milk chocolate. The darker the roux gets, the more you need to stir it, but let it sit for a few seconds before continuing to stir. After about 5-6 minutes, the color of the roux should be nice and dark or similar to the color of a Hershey’s chocolate bar. Set aside some of the roux to use later.</p>
            <p>5. Add 2 bay leaves as well as your “holy trinity” to the pot. Make sure to set aside some of the holy trinity mix for later.</p>
            <p>6. Once the mixture calms down a bit, add the minced garlic to the pot. Let the roux sit for 30 seconds.</p>
            <p>7. Add 8 ounces of beer and stir it in and whisk to prevent the mixture from becoming clumpy. Then, add 4 cups of chicken stock and whisk using the same procedure as the beer.</p>
            <p>8. Take 1 lb of andouille sausage or smoked kielbasa and cut into coins.</p>
            <p>9. Add kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to both sides of 1 lb of boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Sear the chicken thighs in a smoking hot pan with oil.</p>
            <p>10. Add 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt to the roux.</p>
            <p>11. Turn the stovetop temperature to the lowest simmer possible and add a generous amount of black pepper to the roux. Then, add 1 tbsp of smoked paprika and stir.</p>
            <p>12. After browning the chicken, add it straight to the pot and set aside the remaining oil from the chicken. Next, add the chopped up sausage or smoked kielbasa to the pot.</p>
            <p>13. Bring the roux to a bare simmer, cover it, and let sit for a couple of hours.</p>
            <p>14. Serve with cooked white rice, garnish with scallions, and enjoy!</p>

            <p><a href="https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/cajunfood">Binging with Babish</a> I really like the simplicity of his website, it feels clean and relaxing to browse and find recipes indicated by large pictures and their name in bold underneath. Also, having tried his recipe before it was really delicious!</p>
            <p><a href="https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/authentic-new-orleans-style-gumbo/">Tastes Better From Scratch</a> I like how this website includes a large number of photos that showcase the different steps of the recipe in progress. The emphasis on these large photo examples help to provide visual indicators for viewers that make accurately following the recipe that much easier.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.food.com/recipe/real-cajun-seafood-gumbo-from-a-louisianian-333762">Food.</a> I like how simple and direct their website is, with each recipe page only listing the ingredients and steps as needed and leaves the page void of any other distractions.

            <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a> I feel like this website's simplicity allows viewers to be able to easily navigate the site, with shows and movies split into various rows based on different genres. I think the large title images with smaller size text denoting catagories allow for a much more clean-looking site.</p>
            <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> I really like how the website makes playlists and songs easy to find, with a recommended section based on previous listening. The use of large images for album covers and artist images with smaller but simple to read text underneath makes navigating the site feel easy to the eyes.</p>
            <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> I like the way how this website presents information to users with their main section having 3 rows split into top-selling titles, special offers, and player-recommended games that feature large rotating slideshows of the title art and in-game images that let users easily visually understand what each game is about. Their side tab is also easily navigatable and provides a larger wide variety of options for users who may be looking for any specific types or genres.</p>
