            <h2>Lunar New Year</h2>
            <p>Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year, celebrates the beginning of a new year according to the Chinese calendar. During this period of about 15 days, many Taiwanese people celebrate its traditions and more importantly, strictly adhere to the superstitions the come with this occasion.</p>
            <h3>Fireworkers & Firecrackers</h3>
            <p>According to legends, it is believed that during the New Year, a monstrous beast known as Nian would appear and wreak havoc on local villages. The wreckage caused by Nian was only stopped when the colour red was placed everywhere, and fireworks and loud noises were set off to scare the beast away.</p>
            <p>As such, it is now tradition that during the first day of Lunar New Year, fireworks and firecrackers are set off with the intention to scare away any bad luck, spirits, and/or energies.</p>

            <h2>Ghost Festival</h2>
            <p>In Chinese numerology, the number 7 is considered inauspicious when linked to the Ghost Festival, which begins on the fifteenth night of the seventh month. Several taboos are observed during this time.</p>
            <h3>Swimming</h3>
            <p>People should avoid swimming, and bodies of water, so that evil spirits cannot drown the living, and gain a second chance at life. Water-based activities, such as showering, should not be performed after midnight.</p>
            <h3>Wind Chimes</h3>
            <p>Whistling, particularly after dark, is not advised, because whistling is believed to attract evil spirits. Wind chimes should not be hung, as they sound similar to the ringing of souls, the sound of which lures ghosts.</p>
