        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        <p>1. I'm Aaron Cho, a junior and majoring in Communication Design.</p>
        <p>2. I took this class as a requirement for my major though I've been averse to doing any sort of programming in the past. I guess this will be the chance for me to finally try it out.</p>
        <p>3. I've got zero experience with html, css, or js.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn the basics of coding/web design and not see it so much as a foreign language that is unintelligible to me.</p>
        <p>5. Designing on paper feels much more image based and still, while designing on a screen feels more like an animated experience that allows for the possiblilty to change depending on the viewer's interaction with it.</p>
        <p>6. I think <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/">UniQlo</a> is a website with effective design, having a clean, clear and simple directory at the top for people to navigate if they want to shop and large, inviting images with spaced out text that makes scrolling through various outfits feel spacious and relaxing.</p>
        <p>7. I think that <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is a website that excels at communicating its purpose of being a search engine which emphasizes simplicity, user privacy, and security.</p>
        <p>8. I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> is a website that works well at displaying a lot of information in a way that isn't overwhelming to viewers, while also being easily accessible and simple to use.</p>
