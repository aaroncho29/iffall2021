            <h2>Clocks</h2>
            <p>The Chinese phrase for “to give someone a clock” has an underlying meaning of “sending someone off,” otherwise interpreted as wishing death upon the person that was gifted clocks.</p>

        <section id="handkerchiefs">
            <h2>Handkerchiefs</h2>
            <p>Handkerchiefs are usually avoided as an option when thinking about gifts as handkerchiefs are generally used to wipe away tears during sad occasions. Henceforth, gifting handkerchiefs is believed to bring bad fortune upon the recipient due to the downcast association handkerchiefs come along with.</p>

        <section id="sharp">
            <h2>Sharp Objects</h2>
            <p>It is widely accepted that gifting sharp objects such as knives or scissors would come across as the person who prepared this gift to be subtly indicating the intent to sever his/her relationship with the recipient. This is because sharp objects are usually used to cut and separate objects, thus transcending this function into a form of superstition.</p>

        <section id="pens">
            <h2>Red Pens</h2>
            <p>Even though pens are considered as acceptable gifts, it is frowned upon to gift pens with red ink. Red is generally an auspicious colour in the Taiwanese culture, but in terms of red ink, it symbolises blood. Therefore, writing a person’s name in red would come across as wishing grave injuries or even death upon them.</p>
